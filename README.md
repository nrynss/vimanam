# Vimanam

Vimanam is an OpenAPI/Swagger JSON to Markdown documentation generator.

Vimanam stands for Aeroplane in Malayalam. Like an aeroplane, it can fly high and give you a 20,000 feet view of the APIs. It can fly low and give you a detailed view of the APIs. You can also run it along the ground to look deep into the API fields and descriptions.

It supports both OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications.

Besides producing documentation for humans, Vimanam is built for **feeding API specs to LLMs**: a multi-megabyte enterprise spec doesn't fit in a context window, but a filtered, summary-level Markdown rendering of it does. See [Preparing API context for LLMs](#preparing-api-context-for-llms).

## Features

- Convert OpenAPI JSON files to Markdown documentation
- Supports both OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) and OpenAPI 3.0 specifications
- Group endpoints by service or HTTP method, or list them flat
- Filter by service, path, or method
- Multiple detail levels (summary, basic, standard, full)
- Reference resolution to follow JSON references (`$ref`) in specifications
- Server URL information extraction and documentation
- Authentication and security schemes documentation
- Proper content type detection for responses
- Sorting options for endpoints (alphabetical, path length)
- Clean anchor generation for better navigation
- Deterministic, byte-identical output across runs — friendly to diffs, caching, and LLM prompt caching

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nrynss/vimanam.git
cd vimanam

# Run directly without building (development)
cargo run -- input.json -o output.md

# Build and run
cargo build --release
./target/release/vimanam input.json -o output.md

# Or install system-wide
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
vimanam input.json -o output.md

# Group by HTTP method
vimanam input.json --method -o output.md

## Preparing API context for LLMs

Large API specs are a poor fit for LLM context windows: a 3 MB swagger file is hundreds of thousands of tokens of JSON, most of it boilerplate. Vimanam's detail levels and filters act as a token-budget dial, letting you hand an LLM (or a coding agent) exactly the slice of the API it needs, as compact Markdown.

```bash
# 20,000-ft view: every service and operation name, usually <1% the size of the spec.
# Good as always-loaded context so the model knows what the API can do.
vimanam openapi.json --detail summary -o api-map.md

# Zoom into one service when the task touches it — parameters and responses
# included, everything else excluded
vimanam openapi.json --service-filter Findings --detail standard -o findings-api.md

# Slice by path or method instead
vimanam openapi.json --path-filter /v1/scans --detail standard -o scans-api.md
vimanam openapi.json --method-filter GET --detail basic -o read-api.md
```

A workflow that works well with coding agents: generate the `--detail summary` map once and reference it from the project's agent instructions (e.g. `CLAUDE.md`); have the agent regenerate a `--service-filter ... --detail standard` slice on demand when a task involves specific endpoints.

Output is deterministic — the same spec and flags produce byte-identical Markdown — so generated context files diff cleanly in git and don't needlessly invalidate LLM prompt caches.

## Supported OpenAPI Versions

Vimanam supports:
- OpenAPI 2.0 (Swagger) documents using the `swagger` field
- OpenAPI 3.0+ documents using the `openapi` field

## Output Examples
